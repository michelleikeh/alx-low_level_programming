# C - PREPROCESSOR
This project is done in fulfilment of ALX SE training course. During the cousrse of this programme 
* I learned about `macros` and how to use them,
* I learned to use some common predefined macros
* I learned to to include guards in header files.

## Technologies
* Project compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
* All programs are written in C Programming language
* C files written in accordance with `gnu` standards
* C files written in compliance with `Betty style`
