# C - argc, argv

In this project i learned about arguments count `argc` argument vector `argv` using them in functions. I also learned how to used `__attribute__((unused))` to compile a function with parameters that might not be used.
This project was done during **Full stack software Engineering studies* at **Alx SE**.

## Technologies
