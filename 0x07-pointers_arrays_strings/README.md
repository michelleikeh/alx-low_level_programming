# C - Pointers, arrays and strings

In this project, I continued to learn about pointers arrays and strings in C programming.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using gcc
* C files are written according to gnu 89 standard
* C files tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
* C files wriiten in accordance to betty styling

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:
* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files, provided by Alx.

## Header file :file_folder:

* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in this project.

## Files :file_folder:
All files written in C program

| [1-memcpy.c](./1-memcpy.c) | Copies memory area |
| [2-strchr.c](./2-strchr.c) | Locates a character in a string |
| [3-strspn.c](./3-strspn.c) | Gets the length of a prefix substring |
| [4-strpbrk.c](./4-strpbrk.c) | Searches a string for any of a get of bytes |
| [5-strstr.c](./5-strstr.c) | Locates a substring |
| [7-print_chessboard.c](./7-print_chessboard.c) | Prints the chessboard |
| [8-print_diagsums.c](./8-print_diagsums.c) | Prints the sum of two diagonals of a square matrix of integers |
